  <p>RoverX Travel values your privacy. This portal uses Google Sign-In to authenticate users and
  only requests access to your basic profile information (name, email, and profile picture).
  No other data is collected from your Google account.</p>

  <p>Any URLs you enter in the Admin panel (such as Google Sheets or Forms links) are stored
  locally in your browser using <code>localStorage</code>. This means they never leave your device
  and are not sent to RoverX servers.</p>

  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.</p>
